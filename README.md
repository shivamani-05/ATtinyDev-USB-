# ATtinyDev-USB-
This compact ATtiny85 development board is ideal for minimalist projects. It features direct USB programming via a Mini-B port using V-USB, eliminating the need for an external programmer. An onboard 5V regulator allows for flexible power from USB or an external supply. All I/O pins are broken out for easy prototyping.
